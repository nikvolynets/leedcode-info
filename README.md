### Big O

Big O is a notation used to describe the computational complexity of an algorithm. 

Two parts:
* **The time complexity** of an algorithm is the amount of time the algorithm needs to run relative to the input size. 
* **The space complexity** of an algorithm is the amount of memory allocated by the algorithm when run relative to the input size.

Complexity is described by a function.

When written, the function is wrapped by a capital O. Here are some example complexities:

When talking about complexity, there are normally three cases:

* Best case scenario
* Average case
* Worst case scenario
